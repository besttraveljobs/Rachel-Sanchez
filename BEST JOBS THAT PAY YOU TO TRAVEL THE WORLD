10. BECOME A VIRTUAL ASSISTANT




I’ve read about some experienced virtual assistants that are super successful and making like $90k a year. This might be a bit of hyperbole just to start out but you could definitely make a full-time salary to travel on the go.

Glassdoor quotes the average salary to be $42k a year. You could market yourself as a virtual assistant on Fiverr, Freelancer, PeoplerPerHour, VaVa Virtual Assistants, Upwork, Fancy Hands, Belay, or RedButler.




There are a ton of different sites you could apply to and be able to support yourself. You’re really only limited by what you choose to do for work. Keep in mind that some opportunities pay more than others.




I will say that at one point I worked for FancyHands as a contractor and I was not able to find any unclaimed tasks in their system so be forewarned that this might not be the best opportunity.
